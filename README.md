The code that runs my personal website.

## Philosophy
I tried to keep the visual design and backend code simple when working on this website. It should be simple visually so it's not overwhelming to look at, and it should be simple technically so I don't forget how things work and I can upgrade/troubleshoot it easily.

## Style
I take a lot of typographical inspiration from Matthew Butterick's web book [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com) â€” it has answers to all the questions you could think of relating to good typography.

## Backend
The site's pages are served with a Node webserver at `backend/server.js`. The majority of the site's pages are dynamically built using Mustache as a templating system. Templates for pages are in `templates` and HTML-like Mustache content files for pages are in `mustache`.

### Main pages
The main pages listed in the navbar (about/blog/projects/links/contact) are built from the template `templates/main-page.mustache` and use some client-side JavaScript (in `javascript/header.js`) to mark which tab is currently active.

### Secondary pages
The pages that are not listed in the navbar are built from the template `templates/secondary-page.mustache`, but they don't use the client-side JavaScript to handle marking the active navbar tabs.

### Blog
I wrote a custom "blog engine" within the main webserver script (`backend/server.js`) to handle building/serving the individual posts. It uses Mustache as a templating system and Showdown.js to convert Markdown to HTML, so I can write my entries in Markdown (easy and reduces friction). Here is [a blog post about the engine](https://derekandersen.net/blog/new-blog-engine).
