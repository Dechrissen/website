Happy New Year 2023. This first article of the new year is rather appropriate, since it's focused on **tips for living a better life**, but I actually didn't intend for it to be so timely.

I compiled a list of 27 maxims — my tips for living in our modern world. I'm calling it *Derek's 27 Maxims*. So, what's this all about, anyway?

Well, I'm 27 years old. So I came up with 27 maxims. The idea for this list was inspired by [a video I watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vobLTc8Zd1Q) by Campbell Walker (AKA [*struthless*](https://www.youtube.com/c/struthless) on YouTube) in which he listed 32 practical (and sometimes comically specific) tips on living a better life. His video was actually inspired by someone else — [Kevin Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kelly_(editor)), founding executive editor of *Wired* magazine. This man described his bits of advice as "little hats to try on," which resonated with me. I liked the idea of creating a list of helpful tips to share — tips that *you* developed over all the years you've been living *your life*. And, see, they don't need to be taken as gospel. Some of them might not work for everyone, and that's okay. Each one is like a little hat: try it on, and if you don't like it, you don't have to buy the hat. In other words, if you don't like the advice, you don't need to adopt it in your daily life.

I had fun compiling this list. While some of them are a bit humorous, all of them are genuine tips, and I personally practice them. Some of them are even up for a little interpretation. You might see them differently than I do, which is pretty cool.

I should note that in my case, a lot of the maxims are minimalism/intentionalism-related. That's just how it goes up in my brain. I think a lot of people could benefit from being a little more intentional in their lives, and it just so happens that *clutter* (physical and mental) is often how that lack of intentionality manifests.

I hope you find at least one *hat* you like. Or *that* you like. Whichever.

Without further ado, here's the list. (*Tip*: If you prefer a nice PDF of the list instead, it's [here.](https://derekandersen.net/static/documents/Dereks_27_Maxims.pdf))

# Derek's 27 Maxims

1. If you own a smartphone, take control of your notifications. Don't let the notifications control you and your attention. Take some time to customize them so no unnecessary apps ever notify you.
2. Don't keep a notebook with all the pages used up; it served its purpose. The only full notebooks you might want to keep are journals.
3. Don't keep outstanding to-do list items longer than a couple days. If you keep seeing the same task every day, and you're not doing it, it doesn't belong on that list — and it's occupying free space in your mind every time you see it.
4. Make sure all your breakfast-making dishes and utensils are clean the night before, along with the counters. Having to deal with these things in the morning is an unnecessary obstacle to something that should be relatively easy.
5. Don't use tables for temporary storage. Put that stuff away ASAP.
6. Unless you're gonna wear something again, dirty clothes go right in the hamper, not the floor — they're getting in your way, mentally and physically.
7. Just because a friend gives you a gift, that doesn't mean you're obligated to keep it. If it doesn't add value to your life, let it go before it becomes an unwelcome guest in your home.
8. If you can't think for yourself, everyone else is gonna do it for you. Figure out your values and learn to stand by them so you don't become a sheep forever.
9. Remember that language is an innate ability. If some grammatical construction sounds right to you, then it is. There is no wrong. Those who prescribe grammar are pretentious and ignorant.
10. You probably shouldn't identify so strongly with something that is merely a hobby. Learn to recognize what's a hobby and what's a potential pursuit in life, because if you mix them up, you might never get anywhere.
11. An organized house is an organized mind. For real. Keep it clean.
12. It's more important to eat food than to stick to some particular diet. If a friend makes you food that doesn't align with your diet, don't think too much about it. Just eat it. Look at the big picture.
13. The number 13 isn't so scary. And neither are black cats — you should be nice to them.
14. When you're young, people are gonna think they know what's best for you. If you're planning to go to college, make sure you really want (or need) to. That's a big decision.
15. Don't keep a piece of trash because it reminds you of that one time you visited the dump.
16. Being a nice person doesn't mean that you have to show compassion to everyone on Earth. Sometimes, your values and ideals won't align with others'. Be nice to people in your inner circle, and those you meet on a daily basis. If everyone does that, we're probably good.
17. You should exercise.
18. If you don't like something someone says, let it go, and find some people who say things that you do like.
19. Males and females are different. Important in many aspects of life.
20. Don't watch the news on TV. It's just a bunch of fear mongering.
21. Alone time is important. Slow down and sit with your thoughts every once in a while. Recalibrate, and remember why you're here.
22. The highway isn't a racetrack, it's the highway.
23. Don't judge a book by its cover, unless it's an actual book.
24. If you have a thing that's meant to be used, and you don't use it, then you probably don't need to have the thing.
25. When confronted with the choice of 'cat or dog', choose 'dog'.
26. Stay away from "starter kits" and "sets". Those are not made by people who care. Just get all the components individually — put some effort in.
27. Be yourself. Corny, but true. Understand what makes you unique, and own it.

There you go: 27.

I encourage readers of this article to do the same: compile a list of generally applicable life tips that you've acquired throughout your years. Share it with me, and with others.

And, speaking of sharing, I've created a PDF version of my list [here](https://derekandersen.net/static/documents/Dereks_27_Maxims.pdf). You know what would be cool? If you *printed out* the list, and gave it to someone you know — in person! Remember the notion of 'in-person'? Good times.

Share the love. Thanks for reading, and I wish you the best in 2023.
