If you didn't know, I [used to speedrun *Banjo-Tooie* on Nintendo 64](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlL2rIIeW_RXCcrdz-y8bmKXfvGPO9iU9). I don't anymore, but I still regularly tune in to friends' speedrunning streams on Twitch, because I enjoy watching them and hanging out with those friends I made in the speedrunning community.

But, more than speedrunning, I just love *Banjo-Tooie*. And more than that, I just love old video games. Mostly the ones that I played growing up (*Banjo-Tooie* is one example), but really, even if I play an older game for the first time during my adult life (i.e. one that I missed out on when I was younger), I find myself enjoying old games significantly more than new ones. Lately, I find it very hard to get into *new* games. I miss the simplicity of older games -- not necessarily the simplicity of the games, but of the technology and the ritual around playing them.

Older consoles (like NES, SNES, and N64 for example) are so much more elegant than their modern-day counterparts. When I was a kid, if I wanted to play a game, there wasn't much thinking -- I'd walk over to the TV, turn it on, and hit the console's power button, and I'd be playing the game within 30 seconds. Nowadays, you have additional variables to consider before you get to the point where you're playing a game: wireless controller pairing, making sure you're on the right TV input for one of your various devices, navigating a *menu* after you boot up your console, and sometimes, *connecting to the internet*. It's too much these days. Even if I'm able to play a modern game nowadays, something makes it feel different (at least when I'm on my PC), and I think it has to do with the *internet* lurking in the background. It's always there, even if you're not using it -- you could get a friend's message, some kind of update notification, or even be compelled to Alt-Tab into your browser to *look something up*.

Maybe it's just me, to be honest, but I get overwhelmed from all this. I miss the days where I was able to just sit down and play a game, and most importantly, easily get lost in it. The distractions of today are too powerful, and sometimes I need to make a concentrated effort to mitigate them. That's where the topic of today's blog post comes in: my retro gaming setup (with a modern twist; a good modern twist!).


TODO: give it a code name
TOOD: explain my excitement for projects like this
