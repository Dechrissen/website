First entry of 2024. Happy New Year!

I was going through some of my photos, and I found a few pictures I've taken here in Indiana over the last few years. I got the idea to put them together in a sort of "gallery"-type blog entry -- so here they are. A lot of trees, grass, and sky. These are unedited. Just as-is from my iPhone.
