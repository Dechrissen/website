description: Looking back at two years writing this blog, and looking ahead at what's to come.

Today, August 28th, 2022, marks the two-year point since I began writing this blog. I wanted to write a special entry to celebrate the occassion, taking a look back at these last 2 years, and then talking about what I have planned for the coming years.

# Part I: The Past

## The past two years of my life

I'm only realizing it now that I sit down to write this: these past two years have probably been the biggest, most eventful, most trying years of my life. Two years ago was August of 2020; at that time, I was about to begin my final semester of my Master's program in Computational Linguistics. I was struggling with the feeling of not being truly passionate about the field I was entering, and the subsequently the dread of not knowing what I was going to do professionally upon finishing school (a feeling still present in my life now).

In these last two years I've also moved house -- a lot. I went from living in the house I'd grown up in and lived for 25 years, to moving to a new house with my mom for a few weeks, then moving to Indiana with my girlfriend, and then moving to a new place in Indiana half a year later. 

Needless to say it's been pretty stressful. On top of the moving, I started an *actual* job which I've been working at for about a year now -- I'm working as an NLU developer for Cerence, a company which develops voice assistant technology for automobiles. We train machine learning models that handle speech input from drivers -- things like "Can you raise the music volume?" or "Please open the driver side window." But I don't work on the models directly; I help to supply artificial data for the models to train on, or fix bugs that customers report via tickets. All in all, it's good experience, and I'm glad I was able to do it for as long as I have.

I moved away from all of my friends and family, too. Now I live, as many people jokingly say, surrounded by corn in the Midwest. Jokes aside though, I can't say I hate it here -- though I fully expected to. My girlfriend and I came here so she could pursue a graduate degree in psychology. I was reluctant to come along, but I'm glad I did; it's been a positive experience overall.

We've had our difficulties, for sure: relationship issues to overcome, dog ownership struggles (FYI: Dachshunds are terribly stubborn), a lack of friends, and... sometimes, boredom.

There's less to do in Indiana than there is in New York. Well, I guess it depends on how you look at it, but I'm certainly used to more shops and parks and attractions and beaches (not that I always took advantage of them all).

But, to be honest, I've warmed up to life here. I've made a *few* friends -- mostly fellow dog owners I meet outside -- but nobody I feel comfortable enough to fully be myself with, yet. I've also developed some new hobbies. One day, I visited the local gun range. It was fun, so I went back a few more times. Then finally, I purchased my own. So I shoot guns now. Yep.

There are still things I want to do, and some things I've wanted to do for a long time that I can't seem to bring myself to do. I'll save that for later on in the post, though.

## The past two years of this blog

I started this blog mainly to document my projects (I think). My first post was about my first experience with web development. I think at the time, I had planned to delve deeper into web stuff; that didn't happen. I still have a general interest, and I enjoy learning little tricks I can do with front-end design that I can implement on this website, but I don't think I want to devote a lot of my mental resources to it going forward.

The blog quickly became another avenue for me to journal. The very next post was about minimalism and my experience with it, which *is* something that I still place a lot of importance on in my life now. Then after that, I talked about my struggles with perfectionism -- which is when I think I started to focus more on my creativity (meaning, becoming aware of my need to be creative, but recognizing the way my mind prevents me from doing so).

After this, I wrote some more posts documenting projects I was working on (when I had the energy to do them).

So the way I see it, this blog teeters between 3 subjects (can you have a 3-dimenisonal teeter-totter?):

- my **lifestyle**,
- my struggles with **creativity** (or blockages thereto),
- my interest in computers and **technology** (and desire to work on projects relating to these things).

Perhaps a stretch, but I might even say that these three things operate in a sort of cycle. My lifestyle (e.g. my full-time job and lack of energy to develop an exercising routine) sometimes prevents me from feeling creative or having ideas. This lack of creativity (and sometimes perfectionism) prevents me from starting projects -- either because I think it won't turn out good, or because I can't think creatively. 

If this is on the mark at all, you might come to the conclusion that the third item in the list -- the computers and technology -- is the end goal. So maybe I need to treat it as such. Another aspect of my perfectionism-born struggles is the indecision surrounding *what I want to be doing with my time*. I certainly don't feel fulfilled presently, and I have an inkling that I want to pursue something else, but I'm not sure what. I wouldn't be surprised if it's something in the field of technology/computers/programming, but even then, I don't know what it is. (Game development perhaps?)

Right now, I consider myself as jack of all trades in the realm of computers and programming. I know a bit about a lot of subfields, but I can't say I'm a master at any of them. And my ever-present indecision prevents me from zeroing in on one of those subfields (say, back-end web development for example) and honing my skill.

# Part II: The Future

Not surprisingly, for someone who can be labeled "generally anxious", I spend a large portion of my time thinking about the future. I say it's not surprising because this is one of the hallmarks of anxiety: an eye toward the future (usually characterized by a sense of dread). While I'm no stranger to dreading things to come, this isn't the point of this entry.

What I mean to say is, I think a lot about what I want to be doing, how I want to be spending my life, and things I want to have -- whether it's physically (like a house) or more abstractly (like habits).
